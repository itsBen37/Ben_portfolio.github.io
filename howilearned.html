    <h2>How I Learned</h2>
    <p>My coding journey started with curiosity and a desire to solve problems. I began with online tutorials and projects, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
       As I gained confidence, I tackled more complex topics like full-stack development and APIs. 
       Continuous practice and real-world projects have been my greatest teachers.</p>
